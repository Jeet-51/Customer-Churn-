The goal of this notebook is to understand and predict customer churn for a bank. Specifically, we will initially perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** (**EDA**) to identify and visualise the factors contributing to customer churn. This analysis will later help us build **Machine Learning** models to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 

This problem is a typical **classification** task. The task does not specify which performance metric to use for optimising our machine learning models. I decided to use **recall** since correctly classifying elements of the positive class (customers who will churn) is more critical for the bank.

*Models Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine.*
